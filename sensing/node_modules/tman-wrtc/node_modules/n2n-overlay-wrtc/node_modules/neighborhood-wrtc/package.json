  "readme": "# neighborhood-wrtc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RAN3D/neighborhood-wrtc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RAN3D/neighborhood-wrtc)\n\n<i>Keywords: WebRTC, browser-to-browser communication, overlay network</i>\n\nProject that aims to ease the WebRTC connection establishment process. Among\nothers, it alleviates the need to know which socket produced which offer.  It\nalso reuses existing connections instead of establishing new ones, when this is\npossible. It aims to be part of network protocols that build overlay networks\nand to provide them logical arcs - using identifiers - instead of channels.\nFinally, it is designed to handle multiple protocols, for they may share\nidentical arcs. For instance, consider several applications embedded in a single\nweb page, some of them are connected to a same peer. Instead of working\ncompletely on their own, these applications will share the same channel. The\nneighborhood-wrtc module will redirect the messages to the right applications.\n\nNote: The [API](https://ran3d.github.io/neighborhood-wrtc/) may change to face\nthe need of overlay network protocols.\n\nNeighborhood-wrtc is built on top of the (who said amazing?)\n[simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer) project.\n\n\n## Principle\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./img/notsharing.png'> </img>\n</p>\n\nThree peer-to-peer applications ```8O```, ```:|``` and ```>_<``` run in a same\ntab of a WebRTC-compatible browser. When they want to connect to their\nrespective remote counterpart, the browser must establish 3 WebRTC connections,\nfor they do not share any information between each other.\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./img/sharing.png'> </img>\n</p>\n\nUsing this module to create WebRTC connections, they can share it and messages\nwill be automatically redirected to corresponding applications. In this example,\ninstead of establishing and maintaining 3 distinct connections -- which may be\ncostly in terms of time and bandwidth -- neighborhood-wrtc only establish 1. The\nconnection is destroyed only if the 3 applications remove it.\n\n## Installation\n\n```$ npm install neighborhood-wrtc```\n\n## API\n\nYou can find the API [here](https://ran3d.github.io/neighborhood-wrtc/).\n\n## Examples\n\nUsage examples of this module can be found\n[here](https://ran3d.github.io/neighborhood-wrtc/examples/simple.html) and\n[here](https://ran3d.github.io/neighborhood-wrtc/examples/multiple.html).  To\nrun the example, make sure your web browser is\n[WebRTC-compatible](https://webrtc.org) and switch to console mode.\n\nModule [n2n-overlay-wrtc](https://github.com/ran3d/n2n-overlay-wrtc) uses this\nmodule to establish WebRTC connections from neighbor-to-neighbor, i.e., at most\n1 hop distance.",
