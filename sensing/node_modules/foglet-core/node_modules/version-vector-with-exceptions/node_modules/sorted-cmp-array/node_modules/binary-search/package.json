  "readme": "binary-search\n=============\n\nThis is a really tiny, stupid, simple binary search library for Node.JS. We\nwrote it because existing solutions were bloated and incorrect.\n\nThis version is a straight port of the Java version mentioned by Joshua Bloch\nin his article, [Nearly All Binary Searches and Merge Sorts are Broken](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html).\n\nThanks to [Conrad Irwin](https://github.com/ConradIrwin) and [Michael\nMarino](https://github.com/mgmarino) for, ironically, pointing out bugs.\n\nExample\n-------\n\n    var bs = require(\"binary-search\");\n    bs([1, 2, 3, 4], 3, function(a, b) { return a - b; }); // => 2\n    bs([1, 2, 4, 5], 3, function(a, b) { return a - b; }); // => -3\n\nBe advised that passing in a comparator function is *required*. Since you're\nprobably using one for your sort function anyway, this isn't a big deal.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis software is released into the public domain.\n",
